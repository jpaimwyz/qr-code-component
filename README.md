## My process
### Built with
  - Semantic HTML5
  - CSS

### Continued development

Didn't learn somenthing new but it sure helped me practice some old skills. I estimated a time to finish in 50 minutes, and i did finish it in 50 minutes. Next projects i would like to see more of responsive layouts and acessibility in general, despite that, it was a great start and i am happy with the results i achieved.
